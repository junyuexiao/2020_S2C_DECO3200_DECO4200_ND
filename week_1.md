For most people, climate change seems to be out of reach. Most of the time, climate change can not be truly felt by human beings. We can only learn some descriptions from TV, news, magazines or the Internet, such as the police caps are melting six times faster than in the 1990s (the guardian, 2020), which has greatly affected the life of polar animals. But these do not have a significant impact on a normal person's daily life, so it rarely causes people's attention and attention. It is precisely because they don't know and care about or can't get more professional information, so climate change misinformation is more likely to happen in the media information dissemination. And according to Treen et al., Climate misinformation can lead to public confusion and political inaction, rejection or reduction of support for mitigation policies,  Therefore, it is very important to help the public better understand the relevant information of climate change and ensure that it is true, reliable and easy to understand, which can make the public feel that climate change is closely related to themselves rather than just a remote report.
Therefore, we plan to design an app that can make the public feel climate change intuitively, so as to help people better understand the impact of climate change. At the same time, we will launch the "act now" page to tell you what daily actions can mitigate the impact of climate change. Taking the frequent bushfires in Australia as an example, through authoritative information collection and real-time information update, users can input their own location to get the distance between the location of bushfires and their location, and the impact range of bushfires. At the same time, you can also see the loss and impact of bushfires on their compatriots and countries every year in the app, which can arouse their psychological touch. Finally, on the "act now" page, you can see your contribution to reducing the impact of bushfires by clicking on various environmental behaviors. For example, if you use less plastic bags every day, the whole bushfires icon will be smaller.
